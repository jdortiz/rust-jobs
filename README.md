# rust-jobs

This repository contains my work on the code challenge to be
considered for a DevRel position in Teleport.

I will be writing all my notes about this project in an org-mode file
(plain text) that you can read [here](./Design.md "Design.md").

## Usage

The code is organized in a workspace (in the main directory of this
repo) with three packages: `worker`, `worker-api` and `worker-cli`.

### Worker ###

The worker library can be built and tested from the main directory of
this repo using the following command:
```
% cargo test -p worker
```

It also contains an example that can be executed using:
```
% cargo run --example run_jobs -p worker
```

### Worker-api ###

The web service can be started after generating the required
self-signed certificate. You can use these commands (from the main
directory of this project):
```
% cargo build
% mkdir private
% openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private/rsakey.pem -out private/rsacert.pem
% cp worker-api/Rocket.toml.off Rocket.toml
% target/debug/worker-api
 target/debug/worker-api                          210407193650
ðŸ”§ Configured for debug.
    => address: 127.0.0.1
    => port: 8000
-- snip --
```

You can then use `curl` to test the API.

### worker-cli ###

The client set up for TLS communications in Linux, but requires a
change to trust certificates not validated by the OS if you want to
run it in macOS. There is a single line of code commented out, so can
easily be enabled, that will reduce the security, but will allow it to
run. In order to use `worker-client` run `cargo build` from the main
directory of this project, then you can use it as in the following example:
```
% target/debug/worker-cli login jorge sakdfjeqwoir 210405000351
Copy, paste and execute:
export TOKEN="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLC...JyUNVJtm4"
% export TOKEN="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLC...JyUNVJtm4"
% target/debug/worker-cli start -t $TOKEN "ls -l"  210405000641
Starting a job
New job started with id: '5ab65a18-7755-4c16-bcac-dfe08e23055f'
% target/debug/worker-cli status -t $TOKEN 5ab65a18-7755-4c16-bcac-dfe08e23055f
Querying the status of a job
Job '5ab65a18-7755-4c16-bcac-dfe08e23055f' status is DONE(exit code: 0) (0).
% target/debug/worker-cli output -t $TOKEN 5ab65a18-7755-4c16-bcac-dfe08e23055f

--- END OUPUT ---
```

I have added logging capabilities to `worker-cli` to trace the issue
in macOS.  They can easily be enabled using:
```
% RUST_LOG=TRACE target/debug/worker-cli <your params here>
```

And in the case of macOS without disabling the validation of the
certificate, it returns:
```
ERR: Login error: Reqwest error: error sending request for url (https://localhost:8000/auth/login): error trying to connect: The certificate was not trusted.
```

## Documentation ##

The code is documented and the generated documentation can be read
using:
```
% cargo doc --no-deps --open
```
